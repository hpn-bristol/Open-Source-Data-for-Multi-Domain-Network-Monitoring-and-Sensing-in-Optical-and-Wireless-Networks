![Cross-Domain Telemetry Architecture for Optical and Wireless Networks](Telemetry_architecture.png)

The cross-domain telemetry platform integrates distributed and centralised time-series databases, Kafka telemetry pipelines, local and network-level AI engines, digital twins, and network controllers to collect, stream, and analyse monitoring and sensing data from optical and wireless networks. It enables real-time monitoring, cross-domain data fusion, and AI-driven network optimisation.

## One-month Performance Monitoring Data from Optical Networks over NDFF

This dataset contains nearly one month of performance monitoring data collected from a 339-km field-trial testbed over part of the UK National Dark Fibre Facility (NDFF). In this experiment, seven equalised 200GHz-spaced PM-16QAM/QPSK optical signals were generated by Facebook Voyager Transponders, ADVA FSP3000 Teraflex platforms and a Ciena device. These signals were transmitted over the 339-km NDFF link via Bradley Stoke, Froxfield, Reading and Power Gate, and loop back to Bristol.

## Four-week Sensing Data from BDFI and Mshed

![Experiment_Setup](Four-week%20Sensing%20Data/Experiment_Setup.png)
The four-week fibre-sensing campaign was conducted using a bidirectional transmission configuration, where state-of-polarisation (SoP) sensing was employed to monitor the fibre link between 19 September and 16 October 2025.

An ADVA Teraflex transponder launches optical carriers into circulators to enable counter-propagating transmission, with endpoint Circulators 1 and 2 interconnected through the live field fibre. Each circulator output is divided by a coupler: 90\% of the optical power is directed to the coherent receiver, while the remaining 10\% passes through a polariser to enforce single-polarisation and to project the RSOP onto the eigenstate of the polariser before being delivered to a polarimeter (EPS PM1000) and a real-time oscilloscope (Tektronix MSO64B) equipped with a photodetector for sensing. For vibration localisation, an arbitrary waveform generator (Rigol DG4102) supplies a common trigger to both instruments, constraining inter-instrument timing skew to the nanosecond scale. The transmitted signal is 32-GBaud PM-QPSK; the forward and backward channels are centred at 193.4 THz and 191.3 THz respectively, with bidirectional operation over 7.776 km (MVB-BDFI) and 8 km (MVB-M Shed) of urban fibres. 

From 2025/09/19 to 2025/10/08, the data is collected in link BDFI, and from 2025/10/11 to 2025/10/16, the data is collected in link MShed in the formats of mat and CSV. Along the BDFI route, the fibre passes beneath multiple railway tracks near Bristol Temple Meads Station at the 3.2-km point, where it traverses laterally beneath a railway bridge. 

On the automation side, our ISIC end-to-end monitoring platform continuously tracks communication KPIs, like BER, Q-factor, QSNR, received power, etc., and polarisation telemetry (Stokes parameters), with real-time storage and analytics. The data collected by the Polarimeter includes the collection time, S1, S2, and S3 data. Sampling rate: 97656.250 Hz (Ts = 1.024e-05 s). The data collected by the DSO includes the collection time and the voltage value.

## Wireless Access Network Dataset

This dataset is collected from a multiple radio access technologies testbed, and the network architecture is shown in the figure.

   CPE2 <--> 5G

   CPE4 <--> 5G

```

There are four CPEs in the network. CPE1, CPE2, and CPE3 are connected to both 5G and WIFI access points. CPE4 is connected to 5G, WIFI and LiFi access point. MPTCP is enabled in all CPEs. 

The MPTCP path manager is fullmesh: it will try to create an additional subflow for each known peer address, using this endpoint as the source IP address. And the MPTCP implements a simplified version of the BLEST algorithm as its scheduler, trying to avoid HoL blocking. It sends as much as possible over the active path before using the others. 

Traffic is transmitted from CPE1, CPE2, and CPE3 to CPE4 using iperf with MPTCP enabled. And the dataset contains the parameters recorded in all access points and all CPEs during the transmission.
