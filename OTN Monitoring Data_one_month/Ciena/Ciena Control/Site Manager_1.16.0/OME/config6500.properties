# -------------------------------   Description  ---------------------------------------------------------
#  Property file to help user to set the list of the menus to be hidden from the 
#  Site Manager GUI.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#
# --------------------------------   Rules      ----------------------------------------------------------
#
# 1.  Whitespace, colons, and equal signs in the key must be escaped.
#     Example: "Button.edit text" must be escaped as "Button.edit\ text"
# 2.  Whitespace after the key, and including the = and before the value is ignored
#     Example: "Button.edit\ text = Edit...  " has a key of "Button.edit text" and a
#     value of "Edit...  "
# 3.  Multiple lines worth of text must have a \ at the end of the line to "join" the lines together
# 4.  Rules of Hiding the Menu:
#     - Any menu or sub-menu that needs to be removed has to follow the following syntax:
#		APPLICATION_MENUS_HIDDEN = Menu Name
#		Example : APPLICATION_MENUS_HIDDEN = ControlPlane
#	  - If more than one menu needs to be hidden , then these should separated by commas.
#		APPLICATION_MENUS_HIDDEN = Menu Name1 , Menu Name2 
#		Example: APPLICATION_MENUS_HIDDEN = ControlPlane, ODUConnections
# 5. Naming Conventions of the applications to be used to hide the menu are as follows :
#	
#	 Configuration:
#			Equipment Group = EquipmentGroup
#  			Facility Inventory = FacilityInventory
#    				Electrical = FacilityElectrical
#    				Layer 0 = FacilityLayer0
#    				Layer 2 = FacilityLayer2
#    				OCn/STMn = FacilityOCnSTMn
#    				OTNm = FacilityOTMn
#    				OTN = FacilityOTN
#    				Adjacency Discovery = FacilityAdjacencyDiscovery
#  			Integrated Test Set = ITSTest
#  			Cross Connections = CrossConnections
#    				Path Connections = NodalConnections
#    				Transponder Connections = ODUConnections
#    				Count Path Connection = CountPathConnections
#    				EVPL Connections = EVPLConnections
#    				Photonic Connections = PhotonicConnections
#					OTN Connections = OTNConnections
#  			Tandem Connection Monitoring = TandemConnectionMonitoring
# 			Data Services = DataServices
#    				Receive Class of Service Profiles = RXCOSPRF
#    				Transmit Class of Service Profiles = TXCOSPRF
#    				Class of Service Scheduler = COSScheduler
#    				Service Activation Setup = ServiceActivation
#    				Bandwidth Profiles = BandwidthProfileManagement
#    				Segment Management = SegmentManagement
#    				Endpoint Management = EndPointManagement
#    				Endpoint Mappings = EndPointMapManagement
#    				RPR Ring Management = RingManagement
#    				RPR Ring Information = RingInformation
#    				Connectivity Provisioning = ConnectivityProvisioning
#    				Forwarding Database = ForwardingDatabase
#    				Queue Group Profiles = QueueGroupProfileManagement
#    				Queue Group Drop Profiles = QueueGroupDropProfileManagement
#    				Queue Group Scheduler Profile = SchedulerProfileManagement
#    				G.8032 ERP Node Information = ESPRingNodeInfo
#    				G.8032 ERP Group List = ESPRingGroupList
#    				G.8032 ERP Management = ESPRING
#    				Ethernet OAM Provisioning = EthernetOAM 
#  			Photonic Services = PhotonicServices
#    				Photonic Configuration Management = OTS_TOPOLOGY
#    				OTS Management = OTSManager
#    				Domain Optical Controller (DOC) = DomainOpticalController
#    				Shelf Wavelength Topology = ShelfWavelength
#   				Differential Provisioning = DifferentialProvisioning
#    				SCMD Cascading Order = SCMDCascadingOrder
#    				Optical Loopback = OPTICALLOOPBACK
#  			Synchronization = Sync
#  			Test Toolkit = TestToolkit
#  			Control Plane = ControlPlane
#    				OSRP Provisioning = osrpProvisioning 
#    				Routing Profiles = RoutingProfile
#    				Sub-Network Connection = SubNetworkConnection
#			Span of Control = SpanofControl
# 6. If the user wants to hide the entire menu then in that case , the name of the main menu's application is sufficient.
#	 Example1 : APPLICATION_MENUS_HIDDEN = CrossConnections will hide CrossConnects and all other applications under the main menu.
#	 Example2 : APPLICATION_MENUS_HIDDEN = CrossConnections,ODUConnections will hide Cross Connection menu as ODU connection is one of the 
#																			sub-menu under it.
#    NOTE : When the user wants to hide more than one menu/sub-menu, then the menus/sub-menus should be separated by commmas with no space
#			or special/any character in between.If included will not disable the menus.

#	APPLICATION_MENUS_HIDDEN = FacilityElectrical,FacilityLayer2,FacilityOCnSTMn,NodalConnections,CountPathConnections,EVPLConnections,DataServices,TestToolkit,OperationalMeasurements,ODUConnections
