# support properties
# Provides information into BuildServices, on exactly what is
# supported by the currently running launcher/nodal manager
#

# Install Directory 
# -------------
# Install Directory maps the installation subdirectory
# to the plugin key (see below).  
# 1. This value must be added to the installation/runtime directory
#  to obtain the directory where plugin jars/libs etc are installed
# 2. This value must be added to the runtime tmp directory to 
# provide organization to the plugin specific output files.
#
#
# The expected format is 
# install.dir.<plugin.key> = relative directory name
#
install.dir.plugin.SFTPServer = sftpserver


# Plugin Keys 
# -------------
# Plugin key defines fully qualified classname for the plugin
# represented by this support properties.
# Keys are not displayed to the user - but localized versions of the
# keys (found in display.properties) are displayed to the user
# The plugin key must always start with the term "plugin."
#
# plugin.key1 = fully.qualified.classname
#
plugin.SFTPServer = com.nortel.tnui.comms.sftpserver.SSHFTPServer



# -------------------------------------------------------------------- 
# Preference Support
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# There are two parameters available for preference support.  These
# are prefs.topLevel.<someKey> and prefs.subLevel.<someKey>. Both
# parameters use <fqnPVI> which are strings representing fully 
# qualified classnames of classes implementing PreferenceViewI.
# Note that a \ is used in properties files to be a line continuation
# marker and will probably have to be used with these parameters.
#
# prefs.topLevel.<someKey> = <fqnPVI>
#
# prefs.topLevel.<someKey> is used to specify editable preference
# views that are at the top level of the tree structure in the 
# preference edit dialog
# <someKey> = first is reserved to specify the first preference view to
# display in the preference dialog.  prefs.topLevel.first should really only
# be used once, in the base/support.properties file.  
#
# prefs.subLevel.<someKey> = <fqnPVI> \
#                            <fqnPVI of class to link against in dialog>
# Example:
# prefs.two = a.long.fully.qualified.className \
#             a.long.fully.qualified.className.ToLinkAgainst

prefs.topLevel.sftpserverPrefs = com.nortel.tnui.comms.sftpserver.SSHFTPServerPrefPanel

# -------------------------------------------------------------------- 
# Tool Support
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# The following tools parameter can be used in combination with a list
# of fully qualified classnames of javax.swing.Action implementations
# to provide a list of tools actions that will be added to SiteManager's
# main menu bar, Tools menu.
# Note that a \ is used in properties files to be a line continuation
# marker and will probably have to be used with these parameters.
#
#
# If a tools action contains an object(any object) for the property
# equal to "UNSUPPORTED" it will not be added to the tools menu
# when the tools menu is initially created.
#
# Base/common tools are handled with the following format:
# tool.base = fully.qualified.className.implementing.Action_1 \
#             fully.qualified.className.implementing.Action_2 \
#             fully.qualified.className.implementing.Action_....
# 
# ProductType Specific Tools are handled using the following format:
# tool.product.key = fully.qualified.className.implementing.Action_1 \
#                    fully.qualified.className.implementing.Action_2 \
#                    fully.qualified.className.implementing.Action_....


#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Plugin Specific properties
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# The following plugin specific properties can be used to determine whether
# a plugin supports functionality associated with the property.  For example,
# if a plugin supports SNMPv2 or SNMPv3, then the property key representing
# the version needs to be associated with the plugin key
# for that particular plugin.  At run-time, applications can query the Build class
# via helper methods to get the plugin keys that support the property key.
# The format of associating the property key to the plugin key is as follows:
# supports.<property type>.<plugin> = <plugin.key1>
#
# where <property type> is replaced with the specific property name
# where <plugin> is replaced with the specific plugin type
# where <key1> is replaced with the key for that plugin type
# Examples:
# supports.snmpv2.MibBrowser = plugin.MibBrowser
# supports.snmpv3.MibBrowderV3 = plugin.MibBrowserV3
# 
# The Base class makes the assumption that if a plugin specific property is not 
# found for a particular plugin, that product does not support the property.
